# Machete rule: inline `//` comments are banned in production crates.
#
# The only permitted full-line inline comments are the two whitelisted
# justification prefixes mandated by the rust-coding-standards skill:
#
#   // Why:  — a non-obvious invariant, hidden constraint, or exemption
#              justification (e.g. a permitted `let _ =`)
#   // JSON: — a sanctioned `serde_json::Value` protocol-boundary usage
#
# Continuation lines of a whitelisted comment block are allowed. `//!` module
# heads are governed separately (rustdoc placement rules), as are `///` docs
# on public API items. `tests/**` and `build.rs` files are out of scope.
#
# A second check flags `///` rustdoc on items that are NOT public API —
# `pub(crate)`, `pub(super)`, and private `async fn` items (rustdoc is never
# rendered for them). A genuine invariant on such an item belongs in a
# `// Why:` comment; anything else is deleted.
